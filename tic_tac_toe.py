    hint: define a counter and use a nested for loop, like this
          for i in 0 to 3

def UpdateBoard(Board, Tag, Choice):

    Parameters: 
        Board is the game board, a 3x3 matrix
        Tag is 'O' or 'X'
        Choice is a tuple (row, col) from HumanPlayer or ComputerPlayer
    Return: None

         Update the Board after a player makes a choice
         Set an element of the Board to Tag at the location (row, col)

def HumanPlayer(Tag, Board):

    Parameters: 
        Tag is 'X' or 'O'. If Tag is 'X': HumanPlayer is PlayerX who goes first
        Board is the game board, a 3x3 matrix
    Return: ChoiceOfHumanPlayer, it is a tuple (row, col)
    Description:
        This function will NOT return until it gets a valid input from the user
    Attention:
        Board is NOT modified in this function
    hint: 
        a while loop is needed, see HumanPlayer in rock-papper-scissors
        the user needs to input row-index and col-index, where a new chess will be placed
        use int() to convert string to int
        use try-except to handle exceptions if the user inputs some random string
        if (row, col) has been occupied, then ask the user to choose another spot
        if (row, col) is invalid, then ask the user to choose a valid spot

def ComputerPlayer(Tag, Board):

        Board is the game board, a 3x3 matrix
    Return: ChoiceOfComputerPlayer, it is a tuple (row, col)   
    Description:
        ComputerPlayer will choose an empty spot on the board
        a random strategy in a while loop:
            (1) randomly choose a spot on the Board
            (2) if the spot is empty then return the choice (row, col)

def Judge(Board):

        Outcome is 0 if the game is still in progress
        Outcome is 1 if player X wins
        Outcome is 2 if player O wins
        Outcome is 3 if it is a tie (no winner)
    Description:
        this funtion determines the Outcome of the game
    hint:
        (1) check if anyone wins, i.e., three 'X' or 'O' in

            lef col, middle col, right col
            two diagonals
            use a if-statment to check if three 'X'/'O' in a row
        (2) if no one wins, then check if it is a tie
            note: if the board is fully occupied, then it is a tie
